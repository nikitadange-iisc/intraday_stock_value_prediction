1. Price level & range (from summary table)
Very high price stocks (premium names)
SHREECEM (~20,700 avg close, max 32,400)
BLUEDART (~5,300)
DMART (~2,870)
HDFCAMC (~2,690)
PIDILITIND (~1,665)
ICICIGI (~1,300)
These are high-ticket names with large absolute moves, even if % returns are moderate.
Low price, high range stocks
NMDC (~25 avg, 6.4 → 91)
GAIL (~99 avg, 39 → 232)
ADANIPOWER (~171 avg, 15 → 877)
IRCTC (~358 avg, 28 → 1,192)
These have big % swings relative to their low starting price.
Strong price appreciation over history
Many names show large max vs min (strong long-term uptrends):
ADANIGREEN (25 → 2,973)
ATGL (76 → 3,912)
DMART (615 → 5,398)
LTTS (717 → 5,955)
NAUKRI (140 → 1,817)
PIDILITIND (526 → 3,360)
This matches the high positive trend_corr you see later.
2. Liquidity / volume
Most liquid (very high avg volume)
NMDC (~28.6M)
GAIL (~9.3M)
ADANIPOWER (~8.3M)
BANDHANBNK (~5.7M)
DLF (~5.6M)
These are highly traded, better for systematic strategies needing capacity.
Least liquid (thinly traded)
BLUEDART (~12.8k)
SHREECEM (~24k)
LTTS (~129k)
HDFCAMC (~316k)
PIDILITIND (~345k)
These are more “special situations” names – larger slippage risk and position size constraints, even though they may show strong trends.
3. Volatility & tail risk (daily returns)
3.1 Average daily volatility (avg_volatility)
Highest volatility names
IRCTC (0.0304)
ADANIPOWER (0.0283)
NMDC (0.0250)
BANDHANBNK (0.0252)
ADANIGREEN (0.0294)
ATGL (0.0290)
These have larger typical day-to-day % moves.
Lower volatility names
DABUR (0.0121)
PIDILITIND (0.0128)
MARICO (0.0130)
BERGEPAINT (0.0151)
GODREJCP (0.0155)
These are more “defensive” / stable growth type stocks.
3.2 Outlier / tail behaviour (outlier_ratio_log_return_1d)
Very heavy tails in daily returns
IRCTC (~43.7% of days marked as outliers) → extremely spiky, many large moves.
ATGL (~21%), ADANIGREEN (~20%), ADANIPOWER (~19%), SHREECEM (~18.8%), NMDC (~18.6%)
Even relatively stable blue-chip type names (DMART, HDFCAMC, BLUEDART) have ~18% of days as outliers.
More “regular” behaviour (but still with tails)
Bottom of the list (still ~15%): ICICIPRULI, SBICARD, BANDHANBNK, CHOLAFIN, JSWENERGY, GODREJCP.
Even the lowest are >14% outliers, so the universe as a whole is quite fat‑tailed – a warning for risk modeling.
Takeaway:
IRCTC is by far the most “event‑driven” / tail‑heavy; ADANI group, NMDC, SHREECEM, DMART also show frequent large moves.

4. Trend vs volatility (quadrant view)
Using trend_corr (correlation between date and close) and avg_volatility:

4.1 Strong uptrend + high volatility (momentum + risk)
PIDILITIND – trend_corr ~ 0.97, vol ~0.0128
MARICO (~0.95, vol 0.0130)
NAUKRI (~0.92, vol 0.0200)
LTTS (~0.91, vol 0.0186)
DMART (~0.91, vol 0.0167)
IRCTC (~0.91, vol 0.0304)
CHOLAFIN (~0.90, vol 0.0213)
SHREECEM (~0.90, vol 0.0158)
These names have very strong positive trends historically; coupled with even moderate volatility, they are prime candidates for trend‑following style strategies, but risk control is important (especially IRCTC / NAUKRI).

4.2 Strong uptrend + moderate volatility (high quality trend)
DABUR (~0.89, vol 0.0121)
BERGEPAINT (~0.87, vol 0.0151)
GODREJCP (~0.90, vol 0.0155)
ICICIGI (~0.83, vol 0.0159)
These show strong uptrends with comparatively lower daily noise – more “steady compounders”.
4.3 Low / negative trend
BANDHANBNK – trend_corr ~ -0.88: strong downtrend over the sample.
**SBICARD (~ -0.18): mild negative trend.**   These have either structurally eroded in price (Bandhan Bank) or at least underperformed over time, despite meaningful volatility and volume.
5. Combined view / stock‑level conclusions
High‑volatility, high‑liquidity “trading” names
NMDC, GAIL, ADANIPOWER, BANDHANBNK, DLF
Good for intraday/short‑term strategies, but also carry more gap/tail risk. NMDC and ADANIPOWER are particularly volatile.
High‑trend “compounders” with moderate volatility
PIDILITIND, MARICO, DABUR, BERGEPAINT, GODREJCP, DMART, NAUKRI, LTTS, ICICIPRULI, ICICIGI
These look like classic long‑only trend / quality names: strong historical uptrends, manageable volatility.
High‑trend but very illiquid
BLUEDART, SHREECEM, LTTS, HDFCAMC
Attractive trends but thin volumes – more suitable for smaller size or discretionary trading.
Extreme tail‑risk / event‑driven names
IRCTC stands out as simultaneously:
High volatility
Huge outlier ratio
Strong positive trend
A high‑reward but high‑risk name where position sizing and stop‑loss logic are critical.
Structural laggards / mean‑reversion candidates
BANDHANBNK (clear negative trend despite high vol and decent volume).
SBICARD (slightly negative trend).
These could be candidates for either short‑bias or “turnaround” hypotheses, depending on fundamentals.
